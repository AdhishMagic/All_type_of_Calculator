## Live Demo

Once GitHub Pages finishes deploying, your site will be available at:

https://adhishmagic.github.io/All_type_of_Calculator/

If the link 404s initially, wait ~1–3 minutes for the first Pages deployment to complete.

## Local Development

Open `index.html` in your browser, or serve the folder with a simple HTTP server.

## Project Structure

See folders for each calculator. Each contains `index.html`, `script.js`, and `style.css` (or `styles.css`). The root `index.html` links to the individual tools.
